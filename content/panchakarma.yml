  description: >
    Panchakarma means five types of bodily purification, and it must be done by
    considering factors such as the nature of the disease, body constitution,
    and season. Just as we service a vehicle regularly, this precious body also
    needs detoxification and rejuvenation. Panchakarma helps eradicate diseases
    from the root.

      <h2>Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</h2>

      <p>
        Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head occurs when the blood supply
        to the femoral head, which is the rounded end of the femur that fits into
        the hip socket, is disrupted. Without an adequate blood supply, the bone
        tissue dies, leading to collapse of the femoral head and degenerative
        arthritis of the hip joint.
      </p>

      <p>
        AVN can be caused by trauma, steroid use, excessive alcohol consumption,
        and certain medical conditions. Treatment depends on the stage of the
        disease and may include medication, physical therapy, or surgery.
